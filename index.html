                Phillip ‘ImperialHal’ Dosen signed with TSM at the beginning of March 2019 to be a part of its Apex
                Legends squad. He has been an esports competitor for the past two years, notably competing in H1Z1
                tournaments and showing a strong individual performance in the H1PL as a part of Cloud 9. He has
                also been a part of the Fortnite pro scene, having qualified to be a finalist for the Fall Skirmish
                finale at TwitchCon 2018. ImperialHal is a player molded by pressure, thriving in high-intensity
                situations where he is forced to make clutch plays. He mains Wraith, taking advantage of her slimmer
                hitbox and mobility to complement his aggressive playstyle.

            <p>
                ‘Reps’ (previously fpsreps) joined TSM Apex Legends to be a part of the competitive squad at the end of
                June 2019. He is a veteran FPS player, notably achieving top 500 in Overwatch (with a peak of Rank 7) in
                every season he played. Despite this, he chose to keep a low-profile, only choosing to go pro with Apex
                Legends which he has been playing since its release. He got into the competitive scene barely a month
                after, during which he’s won multiple pubstomping tournaments in addition to placing in the money for
                several others. He mains Bangalore, whose movement speed bonuses in addition to the game’s unique
                movement and aiming mechanics allow him to play hyper-aggressively.
